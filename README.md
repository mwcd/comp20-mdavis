# comp20-mdavis

###What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
This repository contains all my individual comp20 projects that are hosted on Github.

###What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was assignment 3. This was my favorite assignment because I feel like it taught me the most. I knew some front end stuff coming into this class, but I'd never done anything backend, and so server side coding was a pretty big mystery to me. This assignment is really what removed that mysticism.

###How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I think I've grown a lot. The biggest area of growth I think I've had has been in teaching myself new things from the internet. In comp40 you get really comfortable using Stack Overflow to debug. However you don't really teach yourself any core things like technologies etc. in 40, and it was in comp20 that I learned some methods for going about teaching yourself entire frameworks and technologies.

###What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing I"ve learned in this course is the beauty of teamwork. In 40, on partner projects, I always had more or less the same experience as my partner. However, the real power of working in a team is that you don't need to be an expert on everything individually, as long as someone is. Two examples of this, both from my final group project, are the way that Rohun totally became an expert on socket.io, and Alexandria already knew how to make wireframes as an Engineering Psych major.

###Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I want to learn about some of the other web stacks and web developement languages like PHP so that I can make sure that I have a reasonably robust understanding of web development for a student.
